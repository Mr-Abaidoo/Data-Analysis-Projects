This repository showcases my data analysis skills through various projects using data tools.

📌 **Project 1: Clinical Trial Analysis (Ziltivekimab - NCT03926117)**

This project analyzes simulated clinical trial data modeled after the RESCUE Study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03926117), which investigated IL-6 inhibition with ziltivekimab in patients with cardiovascular risks. 

🔍 **Key Insights from SQL Queries:**

Demographics & Enrollment Trends: Age, sex, and race distribution of participants.
Completion Status & Dropout Reasons: Completion rates by treatment group, sex, and location.
Treatment Efficacy: Percentage change in inflammatory biomarkers (hsCRP, fibrinogen, SAA).
Cardiovascular Impact: Effects on ECG readings and blood pressure.
Adverse Events: Distribution of reported adverse and severe adverse events.
